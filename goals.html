	<h1>Galvanize</h1>
	<p>I've always been interested in website design and programing. In college, programming came pretty natural for me, but my engineering advisors pushed me away from computer science saying there wasn’t a future in it.</p><br></br>
	<p>I knew about Galvanize starting up in Boulder and heard nothing but good things. When my company shifted its business to a work at home model, I ended up shopping around for jobs and realized that I wasn't passionate about the work I was doing. That's when I decided to apply to Galvanize.</p>

			<h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>
			<p>Lately I've been noticing a lot of cool stuff happening on the web. One of my biggest inspirations for this page is Apple's MacBook page. I love the JavaScript scrolling elements and animations on the page that help the user focus their attention on what the developer intends.</p>

			<h1>To Learn How Things Work</h1>
			<p><cite>The Way Things Work</cite> by David Macaulay has been my favorite book since I was a child. I'm very much a visual and hands on learner. In the next 24 weeks my goal is to take the concepts learned in class and expand upon them to fully understand and implement them in ways I hadn’t originally thought of.</p>

			<h1>Meet Cool New People!</h1>
			<p>Already the people I have met through Galvanize are AMAZING. I find myself constantly being inspired by everyone that I meet. During the month of June I took a four week JavaScript workshop and got to meet three other classmates that are in the August g32 cohort. I can’t wait to meet the rest of the class and continue being inspired and learn from their experiences.</p>

			<h1>Enjoy the Journey</h1>
			<p>In life, there are rarely any certainties. To be prepared, you must draw upon your resources and experience to help you out along the way.<br></br>I'm not 100% sure where I will land after Galvanize, but I'm thrilled about the journey. I could see myself working for a small or large business doing either front-end UX design or going into back-end development. I'm sure I'll have lots of questions for Craig &amp; Mukai along the way, but for now let’s get going!</p>
